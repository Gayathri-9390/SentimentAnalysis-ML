# Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews

A Python-based project that predicts the sentiment of product reviews (positive, negative, or neutral) using Machine Learning. The project includes both a **GUI** and **CLI** interface for interactive sentiment prediction.

---

## **Features**

- Train a machine learning model (Logistic Regression with TF-IDF) on product reviews.
- Predict sentiment via **CLI** or **GUI**.
- Handles **short reviews**, **multiple reviews**, and **empty lines**.
- Save predictions to a **CSV file**.
- User-friendly GUI with enhanced colors and fonts for better experience.

## **Setup Instructions**

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SentimentAnalysis-ML.git
cd SentimentAnalysis-ML
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model (optional if you already have sentiment_model.pkl):

bash
Copy code
python src/train_model.py
Run the GUI:

bash
Copy code
python src/predict_gui.py
Enter one or more reviews in the top box (one per line).

Click Predict Sentiment.

View predictions in the bottom box.

Click Save Predictions to save results to predictions.csv.

Screenshots
(Optional: Add a screenshot of your GUI here to showcase your interface)

Usage Example (CLI)
bash
Copy code
python src/predict.py
Type reviews interactively.

Get immediate sentiment prediction.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

Tkinter (GUI)

Pandas / CSV for data handling

Future Work
Expand dataset – Include more product reviews to improve model accuracy.

Advanced models – Experiment with other ML algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning models) for better predictions.

Sentiment visualization – Add charts/graphs to visualize positive, negative, and neutral review distribution.

GUI enhancements – Add themes, icons, or interactive features for better user experience.

Multi-language support – Extend the system to handle reviews in multiple languages.

Web version – Deploy the project as a web app for wider accessibility.

Notes
The model can be improved by adding more labeled reviews.

Short reviews like "good" or "bad" are handled via keyword matching.

The GUI is designed to be user-friendly with colors, fonts, and save functionality.
